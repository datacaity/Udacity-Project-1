## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

For this project I used the following libraries for python: numpy, pandas, plotly, plotly.express, seaborn, and matplot.pyplot.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

With this data I wanted to consider my options to maximize my list price potential for an Airbnb in Boston, if I was looking to get started as a host. 

I wanted to know:
1. What neighborhoods should I consider?
2. How many bedrooms/bathrooms etc do I need to be prepared to purchase?
3. What kinds of properties list at higher prices?
4. What is the seasonality for list prices in the neighborhoods I'm considering? What months yield higher prices than others?

These questions are then explored through a blog post hosted on Medium, and is a hypothetical exercise for a Udacity course.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 datasets saved from Kaggle's Open Source Boston Airbnb data. They include a thorough listings dataset with the bulk of the listing data, a calendar dataset to look at list prices for specific days, and a reviews dataset to explore guest thoughts of their stays.

The Project1 notebook reads this data, cleans it, and does some exploratory analysis of what I might expect from investing in a Boston Airbnb.

PNG files were saved off for use in my blog post.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

You can explore my hypothetical Airbnb investment journery [here](https://medium.com/@data.caity/investing-in-a-boston-airbnb-0a3bbaeaa523). Feel free to validate using my Project1 jupyter notebook, or make any adjustments based on your own interests/neighborhoods.
